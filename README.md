# FancySettings

Would like to keep a note of all my developer settings as I switch around machines. I know there are some cool extensions we can use for this, but I wanted to keep my own log for this in case other are curios.


## VSCode 
[VSCode User Settings](./userSettings.json)

### Extensions
- `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
- `yzhang.markdown-all-in-one`
